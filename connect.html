                The pandemic and social distancing have challenged us to come up with new ways of connecting.
                SANITAS hopes to help you connect with others through three main ways: connectivity games, 
                scheduling calls, and sharing blog posts. 
            </p>

                <P class="text">
                Call your family and friends and play our connectivity game together! The aim of the game is to get to know each
                other better and to understand how each person is doing. The game generates random questions designed to spark 
                genuine and thoughtful questions. Being apart does not mean you can't grow in your relationships!

                <P class="text">
                It gets hard organizing all the various calls you need to make. Use SANITAS to schedule calls so you never miss
                out on a call. You can set up a reminder or send out an invitation to others to join a call.

                <P class="text">
                Maybe you're not in the mood to call others or find it difficult to schedule the time. Why not write
                something instead? Write about your day or a funny memory you just recalled or how you're feeling. 
                Writing can be the best form of therapy! If you'd rather keep the blog post private, you can always write for your eyes only!
